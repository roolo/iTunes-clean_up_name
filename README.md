## Installation
Copy or link `Clean up name.scpt` into `~/Library/iTunes/Scripts`. If you don't have the `Script` folder just create it. 

If this is your first iTunes AppleScript you shall see new icon in OS X menubar while iTunes app is active.

This menubar item enables you to run you AppleScripts from iTunes. Another option is make a selection in iTunes and then run the script from Script Editor app, which is also good way if you want to make some adjustments in this AppleScript file.
